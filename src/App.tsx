            <p>
              For events with a single All Around Champion Award, percentages are based
              on the number of teams at the event. For blended grade level
              events with two grade specific Excellence Awards, percentages are
              based on the teams in each grade level for each award.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc m-4">
              <li>
                Under certain conditions, at “blended” events which combine both
                grade levels (middle school and high school ), one All Around Champion Award 
                per grade level maybe awarded. This is determined by the Qualifying Criteria. 
                In the instance of two grade level specific All Around Champion Awards being
                given out at an event, teams are only compared to teams of the
                same grade level. This includes quantitative event data, such as
                rankings. When only one All Around Champion Award is given out for an
                event with multiple grade levels, all teams are considered
                together without regard for their grade level.
              </li>
              <li>
                For example, in a 24-team blended event with a single All Around Champion
                Award, 50% of 24 teams would be 12.To be eligible for 
                All Around Champion, a team would need to be
                ranked in the top 12 in the event for the above performance
                metrics to be eligible for the All Around Champion Award. If the event
                had 12 teams of each grade level, thus meeting the requirements
                for two grade level specific Excellence Awards, then 50% of 12
                teams comes out to 6,
                teams would need to be ranked 6th place or higher within their
                grade level in the above performance metrics to be eligible for
                the grade level specific Excellence Award.
